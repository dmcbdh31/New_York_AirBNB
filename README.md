# New_York_AirBNB

I think what makes a successufl AirBNB rental is the neighborhood the rental is located.
I also think the hotel is what makes the AirBNB successul. It seems the more popular rental was the hotel rather than the actual people.
I think location seems to be a factor as well as the availability and price.
